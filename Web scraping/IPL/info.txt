Head over to Rajasthan v KKR, where Nitish Rana has fallen for a golden duck after Rajasthan put KKR in.Ruturaj Gaikwad: I was confident coming in [based on the last domestic season]. Even in club games, even for Maharashtra, I've to play the anchor and take the team to the end. It did hurt not to be part of the squad that flew at first and miss the first few games, but the management  and team was supportive. First one or two games it was surreal to be around some of the big names.Ruturaj Gaikwad is the Man of the Match.MS Dhoni: It was a difficult campaign. We committed a lot of errors. The last four games were a template of where we would like to be. Proud of the guys because if you're lagging behind for 7-8 games, it becomes really difficult. It's not easy, you won't want to be in a dressing room that's not enjoying cricket. Proud of them. A lot depends on what BCCI decides about the auction. We need to slightly change our core group and looks for the next ten years. At the start of the IPL we made a team that served us well for ten years. It's time to hand it over to the next generation [paraphrased]. Message to the fans - we'll come back strong. That's what we're known for. We are eighth in the table but 14 points and we could have qualified. This is a season where only one team played well (Mubai) or most teams played well. [The jerseys] maybe they thought I'm retiring! Whenever we have seen Rutu bat, he's somebody who has done well in net sessions. But we were not able to see him in games. Then he got Covid, and even after 20 days he was not fit. He didn't get time for us to gauge. That was one of the main reasons we kept going with Faf and Watson. It didn't work. But that's the point where you go with the experienced players.Faf du Plessis: Scoop is a shot that I play often. Bummed that I couldn't get it away. It's been a disappointing season but we at least finished with three wins. [Gaikwad] Looks like a young Kohli doesn't he? What stands out for me is that he stands up to pressure. That's the quality you look for in young players to see if they get to the next level. [Coming back next year?] I've told you this the other day - red wine is the term I use. I'm still loving it. I've got a lot of cricket left in me, at least five more years.KL Rahul: It is as simple as that. We didn't bat really well. Big pressure game, we expected 180-190. We couldn't soak in the pressure. We didn't have the results going our way in the first half. The team still felt like we were playing good cricket. We were patchy. The bowling and batting wasn't coming together in the first half, proud that we did it in the second half. Lots to be proud of as a team. a lot of "could have been". It is disappointing. We had a lot of games in our pockets and we couldn't get over the line and we ony have ourselves to blame. That short run game too, looks like it has come back to bite us.Vyshakh: "I really hope Punjab's owners don't sack the captain and coaching staff like they usually do. They have something good going here, They should be patient and try work on their weaknesses for next year's tournament. "Sukhbir: "Such an unfortunate end to an promising IPL for KXIP, lost 2-3 close games. well played guys."Ahmed Ibrahim: "KXIP's win was the best chance to kick one of RCB or DC out and I was looking forward to it as both those teams were fighting for top spot till last week. Cricket is fun!"sreejith: "Without a doubt, most of KXIP matches are pure thrillers in thie season. They are a good team, better luck next time."Mani: "The team last placed in the points table of this IPL will have at least 12 points. That's already the maximum points for the last placed team in any IPL. Shows how competitive the tournament has been."5:37pm Heartbreak for KXIP and somber faces all around as they hug each other. It was a season that began with a spiral, some of it their own doing, others a result of close matches. This one will hurt doubly as a result, because they put a stunning streak of five consecutive wins before falling short in their last two games. The hunt for a maiden IPL title continues. For CSK, a weird season of their own comes to an end. Their fate was sealed pretty early this season, but it's ended in some cheer at the end. A look down the table and they can now say they didn't really do worse than anyone else. But it is a bit more significant than that, especially because we might have seen the last of CSK as we know it in terms of team composition.18.51Gayle to Rayudu, 1 runmisfield at cover and that is it for both teams this season.
